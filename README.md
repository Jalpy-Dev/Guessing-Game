# Guessing Game
 Super simple guessing game made with python
 
 
 Please note I wanted to practice with the 'sys' module which is why you have to run the program through console
 To Run:
	python3 path to file/guessing_game.py {whatever starting number you want} {whatever ending number that you want}
